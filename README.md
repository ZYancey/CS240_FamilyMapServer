# Family Map Server Assignment

This project focuses on designing, implementing, and testing the Family Map server.  The server is a regular Java program.  When it runs the server does not display an interactive user interface (i.e., it is “headless”).  Rather than interacting with a user, it waits for Family Map clients to connect to it over the Web for the purposes of authenticating user logins and retrieving user family history information.  Although it has no user interface, the server may display diagnostic or informational messages in the console and/or in a log file.  This can be useful for debugging the server and monitoring its operation.  Additionally, because we do not have real family history data for our users, part of the server’s functionality is to generate artificial family history data for each Family Map user.

### *The purpose of this project is to learn about and gain experience with the following:*
  - Designing, implementing, and testing a large, multi-faceted program
  - Relational database concepts and programming
  - Creation of server programs that publish web APIs
  - Automated unit and integration testing
